sets a D T M F command that is used to switch the node between enabled and disabled.

When disabled, the transmitter will not be turned on by any event. If a module is active when the node is disabled, it will be deactivated and no module activation will be allowed while disabled. Only the enabling command will be accepted while disabled.

If the D T M F command is set to 1234 then use 1 2 3 4 followed by a 1 for enabling the node and 1 2 3 4 followed by a 0 for disabling.
