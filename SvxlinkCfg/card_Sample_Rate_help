This variable sets the sample rate for audio input & output. Svx Link always uses a sample rate of 8000 internally. There are some benefits from using a higher sample rate. 

On some sound cards the filters at 8000 are poor and amplitude response is not uniform which can cause issues in the software DTMF decoder.

Supported sampling rates are: 8000 16000 and 48000
